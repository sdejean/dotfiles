sdejean's dotfiles
==================
This repo contains my personal config files for my most used *nix apps

Using dotfiles
--------------
Most files within this repo DO NOT have the "." pre-pended to the file name, so you will have to do that yourself when copying them into ${HOME}.

For example:
    ~: cp -v ~/src/dotfiles/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
